# Paulorefactored
Code was operational but not structure and needed to be broken into Controllers and Models.

I begin adding a route file that would take the user to the correct controller.

I used some eloquent functions to help manage the data from a possible database.

Done. As a developer applying for a job I wouldn't mind writing a test to confirm all works.
